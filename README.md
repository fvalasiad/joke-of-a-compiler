# joke-of-a-compiler
This project isn't meant to be taken seriously by anyone.

My work consists of dealing with compilers one way or another, but I only ever really had
the chance to write a dummy C-like language to MIXAL compiler as a university project. This is essentially
a step forward by doing something more challenging in my rather minimal spare time nowdays.
